#### How to get there

**Amsterdam to Delft train station:** Amsterdam is well connected to the rest of the world. From Schiphol Airport you can take a direct train to Delft (around 40 minutes). 
+ For information on the actual timetables and prices, download the NS app or the 9292 app, or visit ns.nl or 9292.nl. 
+ You can pay for your trip with your debit or credit card (Maestro, V PAY, Mastercard or Visa are supported) at the entrance gates of the station. If you do not have a supported card, you can digitally purchase a train ticket via the 9292 or NS app (note that the 9292 app also allows to purchase bus tickets). 


**Delft train station to hotel:** The Delft train station is within walking distance of most hotels (5-15 minutes).

**To the venue:** The Aula Conference Centre is within walking distance (25 minutes) of Delft Train Station. 
Alternatively, the venue can be reached by bus, which leaves from the south side of the station. 
+ Take bus number 69, 455, or 174 and get out at 'Halte Aula TU, Delft'. For actual timings, see the NS app or the 9292 app, or visit ns.nl or 9292.nl. 
+ Bus tickets can be purchased on the bus itself, using your debit or credit card (Maestro, V PAY, Mastercard or Visa are supported). Alternatively, you can purchase a bus ticket via the 9292 app. 

**Transport by car:** The parking lot closest to the venue is located at the Van der Waalsweg (to reach the parking lot, after leaving the roundabout, you directly take the right). 
+ The hourly rate is 2 euros/ hour, with a maximum of 10 euros daily. Note that the gates do not open if the parking lot is full. In that case, please resort to the parking lot at the Van den Broekweg 1. 
+ You need to scan a mifare card (e.g., your bank card or credit card) to enter. When scanning your card, no transaction will occur; you need to pay at a machine in the parking lot before you leave. 
+ Do not park in the nearby neighborhood, i.e., non-TU Delft parking areas, since you need a permit for that! 
+ Please, visit [this](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/about-tu-delft/contact-and-campus/parking-policy) and [this](https://www.tudelftcampus.nl/accessibility/) websites for more information on accessibility and parking.

### Restaurants and bars

Delft boasts a diverse culinary landscape, thanks in part to its thriving international student community. Within the city center, conveniently located within walking distance from the campus or accessible via bus, we recommend a selection of restaurants to satisfy a range of tastes: 
+ "THUIS by Ladera": Immerse yourself in an authentic Dutch dining experience. Please make a reservation in advance, as it tends to fill up quickly. 
+ If you're in the mood for pizza, consider trying "Bas Sil," "San Marco," or "Il Peperoncino." 
+ Vegetarian or simply craving some veggie-focused cuisine? Head to "Hummus" or "The Harvest." 
+ Embark on a global culinary journey at "Mekhong Thai-Lao" (Thai) or "Redjeki" (Indonesian). 
+ For a cozy and inviting atmosphere with dishes inspired by far-flung locales such as South Africa, Mexico, Thailand, Peru, and Sri Lanka, venture to "Hanno Groots Cafe."
